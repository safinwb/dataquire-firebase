# Dataquire: Just me playing with UI, Firebase and NodeMCU
Experimental test of using firebase and esp8266. Also just working out to build a great UI.

Note: I know the whole thing is un-secure and scripts/key/api's are visible. This is just a prototype test, I will improve my skills over it. Ok bye.
